# Patchwork-Framework

This project pursues the goal of implementing own functions (probably going
to be a *forum*) without the usage of a framework.

At the end of the yet unknown project period, this *framework* should have the following features:
- Logging
- Autoloading
- Routing: Controllers/Views
- Template Engine
